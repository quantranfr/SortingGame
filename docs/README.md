# SORTING GAME

![](img/title_screen.png)

In this game, a player has to follow the instruction on the screen and place the right cards onto the right card readers. Let's see how quick you can finish this game!

Waitâ€¦ cards and readers? In fact, unlike other computer games, this game is intended to be interactive with the physical world (everyone loves that), so by "cards" and "readers", I mean the real ones: NFC tags and NFC readers. The hardware part (and the code for that) is described in a separate repository.

So to test this game, we have to do some simulation. Here are the steps to do it:

* Install `python` and the `websockets` module;
* Run the game;
* Run `python -m websockets ws://127.0.0.1:9080` in your terminal;
* At the prompt, type `<action>[:<cardID>]:<readerID>` for each card manipulation. For example (leading to a win at the time of writing):

```
> ADD:C9:R0
> ADD:C8:R1
> ADD:C7:R2
> REMOVE:R0
> REMOVE:R1
> ADD:C8:R0
> ADD:C9:R1
```

with `C9` simulating the card number 9 and `R0` is the first reader on the left.

## Context

This educational game is born to serve ExploraScience - the first state-own science center in Vietnam, located in the coastal city of Quy Nhon.

It's made in Godot, an open-source platform for game creation.

> The assets (audio) are borrowed from [Dodge the Creeps!](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html) - an example game in Godot documentation.

## Roadmap

* Make config files to store cardIDs and readerIDs
* Internationalization
* Change music
* Add more card readers (and also change the sreen to paysage mode)
